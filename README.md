# Ethereum Wallet app

## App desing to send ethereum and records it in the blockchain

This project is to showcase a web 3.0 application that acts an ethereum wallet, for this project I have used the following languages and libraririe:
## React, Javascript , Tailwind, Navbar and Hardhat,


First I guided myself from online resources to code and followed a guide to created the front-end and back end app to showcase and hold the solidity contract and deploy it in a more professional setting.
hardhat was used to deploy the solidity contract.
With a stunning design, connected to the blockchain, metamask pairing, interaction with smart contracts, sending Ethereum through the blockchain network
## demo

also is showing it connects with metamask to perform the transaction (also it takes it the gas fee).

now it shows the transaction went through and recorded it in the blockchain.
